**Ecommerce Segmentation**

**What exactly is Segmentation - 'Market Segmentation'?**
Basically, Segmentation is an act of dividing something into different parts that are known as segment and clusters in terms of machines.
In marketing, market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing and potential customers, into sub-groups of consumers based on some type of shared characteristics.

**Why create segments of customers in business/markets?**
Segmenting customer base helps in better understanding the customers and thus personalizing marketing and communication for each segment. This is very beneficial because people tend to respond better and be of greater value to your business when they feel their needs and interests are being specifically addressed.
